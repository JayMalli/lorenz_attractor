&nbsp; &nbsp; It's a Lorenz Attractor which is created in Processing.

<p align="justify"> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Lorenz attractor is an example of a strange attractor. Strange attractors are unique from other phase-space attractors in that one does not know exactly where on the attractor the system will be. Two points on the attractor that are near each other at one time will be arbitrarily far apart at later times.<br>
